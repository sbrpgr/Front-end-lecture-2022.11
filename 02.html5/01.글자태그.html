    <p id="id1" class="paragraph">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p> 
    <p id="id2" class="paragraph"> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p> 
    <p id="id3" class="paragraph"> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <b>Aldus PageMaker</b> including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
